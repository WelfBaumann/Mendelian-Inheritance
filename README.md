# Mendelian-Inheritance
This code was written, commented, and published by Welf Baumann and Ole Ahrenhold.

The project is our first big one respectively, so itâ€™s a bit messy and simplistic using the same Python functions.

The code was written for Windows devices.
For the code to also work on MacOS or Linux devices, the path in which the file is saved must be changed (lines 168-170 and 195-196).

The code may not work properly when run in the console.
